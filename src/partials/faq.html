              Elevzio is designed for solo consultants, creators, coaches, and
              small digital studios who are looking to improve operations,
              automate client workflows, and scale their service or
              product-based offerings. If you're delivering 1:1 services,
              running courses or memberships, or preparing to launch a new offer
              — we help build the backend that makes it sustainable.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              We work best with people who are already offering value but feel
              friction in the way they manage content, leads, onboarding, or
              delivery.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              Our systems support those who want structure without complexity
              and growth without burnout.

              Not at all. In fact, many of our clients come to us precisely
              because they’re overwhelmed by tech or unsure how to choose tools.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              We specialize in simplifying complex operations using
              beginner-friendly tools like Notion, Airtable, Zapier, Tally, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              We’ll recommend only what you need, and we’ll document everything
              so you feel confident using your system long after the project is
              over. We believe your systems should work for you — not the other
              way around.

              Depending on your needs, projects typically fall into three sprint
              formats: 3-day, 5-day, or 7-day intensives.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              Each sprint includes live sessions, async build time, and feedback
              loops to make sure we’re hitting your goals.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              If you already have clarity on your offer and audience, we can
              move faster. If you’re still figuring things out, we’ll spend more
              time mapping strategy before implementation. No matter the size,
              we always deliver documented, usable systems by the end of the
              sprint.

              Our preferred tech stack includes Notion (for operations and
              content), Zapier and Make (for automation), Tally (for form intake
              and client flow), Airtable (for data tracking), and platforms like
              Gumroad, Stripe, or ConvertKit for payments and email.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              We also integrate AI tools like ChatGPT and image generation to
              accelerate content workflows or idea mapping.

            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              If you’re already using tools, we’ll audit and optimize your stack
              rather than start from scratch. We choose tools based on your
              business model, not just trends.

              Clarity sessions are 90-minute strategic calls that help you see
              where you're stuck, what to prioritize, and how to move forward.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              They’re great if you’re not sure what system to build yet or want
              a roadmap before committing to a sprint.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              Sprints are implementation-focused — we build, test, and launch
              your systems together over several days. Many clients begin with a
              clarity session and then book a sprint within a week. You can also
              request a tailored recommendation during your clarity session.

              Yes. After your sprint, we offer monthly system support and
              evolution plans.

            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              This is ideal if you want us to manage updates, tweak automations,
              or integrate new tools as your business grows.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-bottom-text">
              We also offer quarterly audits, Notion upgrades, and team
              onboarding for clients scaling beyond solo. The goal is to make
              sure your systems stay aligned with your growth — without you
              needing to constantly rebuild. You’ll have peace of mind knowing
              your business infrastructure is handled.
